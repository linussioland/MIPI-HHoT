# MIPI-HHoT
This dataset contains the full indicators of minimum income adequacy presented in Marchal, Siöland & Goedemé (2018) at the University of Antwerp's Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy. Simulated using the Hypothetical Household Tool (HHoT) of the European microsimulation model EUROMOD, the dataset is a continuation of the CSB-Minimum Income Protection Indicators Database, aiming to present a set of rigorous indicators of minimum income adequacy which is comparable across European countries.

The project is ongoing. The present dataset release is 1.0.1, released online on 08 January 2019.
